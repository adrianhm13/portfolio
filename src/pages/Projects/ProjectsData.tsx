        One of the biggest challenges of this project was the idea of working
        with <span>Firebase</span>. Grouping the data in a way that was
        accessible to the different functionalities that I have implemented to
        the project. <br />
        <span>The use of Emotion</span> was also remarkable, as it has allowed
        me to learn the use of styled components and strengthen my CSS
